# accessible-webpage

Edited the provided HTML and CSS to meet accesibility requirements, including use of semantic html elements, alt attributes on images, organizing the structure, and adding an appropriate title.

Also cleaned up the code, such as combining duplicate CSS rules and removing erroneous /img tags.

Also added smooth scroll to the header links and fixed one broken link.
